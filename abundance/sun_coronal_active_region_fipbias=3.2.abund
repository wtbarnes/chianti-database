filename: sun_coronal_active_region_fipbias=3.2.abund

This is a general `coronal' set of abundances for active regions,
where the abundances of the low-FIP elements
have all been increased by 0.5 dex (as noted in the fourth column), compared to the
photospheric abundances recommended by 
 Asplund, M., Amarsi, A.M., & Grevesse, N. 2021, A&A, 653, A141
 
The increase corresponds to a FIP bias=3.16 and is generally consistent with the
coronal values recommended by
Feldman, U., Mandelbaum, P., Seely, J.L., Doschek, G.A., Gursky H., 1992, ApJSS, 81, 387
which were based on a series of papers where the relative abundances in active regions
showed such FIP bias, compared to the photospheric relative abundances. 

Note that the photospheric abundances accepted in 1992 were quite different
than the most recent ones, hence the present revision.

Also note that each solar feature might have different abundances.
The present values provide a general set that is applicable to the
hot (T > 1 MK) emission in active regions.
