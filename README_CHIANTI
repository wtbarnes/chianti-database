         A DATABASE FOR EMISSION LINE SPECTROSCOPY

                     Version 6.0.1

CHIANTI consists of a database of atomic data and IDL procedures for
calculating spectroscopic emission line intensities from optically thin
astrophysical spectra as a function of density and temperature. 

CHIANTI includes atomic parameters such as ion level energies, ionization
potentials, spectroscopic informations, and transition rates for spontaneous 
radiative decay, electron and proton excitation and de-excitation, and
parameters for the calculation of continuum radiation.

The original paper describing the database has appeared in 1997 in Astronomy 
and Astrophysics Supplement Series, 125, 149, authored by K. P. Dere (NRL), 
E.  Landi (U. Florence), H. E. Mason (U. Cambridge), B. Monsignori Fossi
(Arcetri) and P. R. Young (U. Cambridge). Since then, CHIANTI has undergone
several major updates to include data for many more ions and physical
processes, as well as to update and to expand the data of the ions already
in the database.

With Version 6, CHIANTI includes a complete database for total ionization
and recombination rates, as well as routines to read the files that contain
the data and to calculate the ionization balance. Data for new ions have
been included, and data for many existing ions have been updated or expanded.

Version 6.0.1 corrects a problem in the calculation of continuum radiation
for isothermal plasmas, and in the inclusion of ionization and recombination
effects into level populations, as well as a few typos in cr_7.wgfa, mn_8.wgfa,
fe_18.cilvl and fe_18.reclvl.

The CHIANTI database, IDL software and User Guides are distributed freely
and they are available in the Internet, at the following addresses:

Naval Research Laboratory, USA     : http://chianti.nrl.navy.mil/chianti.html
University of Florence, Italy      : http://www.arcetri.astro.it/science/chianti/chianti.html
University of Cambridge, UK        : http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/astro/chianti

CHIANTI is also freely distributed as part of the SolarSoft package 
(http:www.lmsal.com/solarsoft).
